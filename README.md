This study examines the use of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent-based models (MABMs) to simulate epidemic simulations. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a bottom-up computational approach used for understanding the structure of collective behaviors based on simple agent-based rules. Traditionally, these rules outlined individual agent-based behavioral, and interactions drive emergent patterns at a larger length scale. Traditionally, an agent is assigned hard-coded behaviors and interactions which enables it to interact with other agents and its environment. 

Taking this simple concept, we explore the application of LLMs in MASs, leveraging natural-language processes (NLPs) to understand the influence of LLM-driven decisions on agent behaviors, interactions, and global emergence patterns. This approach replaces the hard-coded programs of agents with LLM-driven prompts. These structured, rule-based prompts allow us to delegate agent decisions to the LLM in a natural-language format thus, ushering in a new paradigm for ABM: Agentic AI. This shift, although critically nuanced, offers transparent guidance in agent decision-making processes and empowers flexible prompt-based approaches for understanding agent behavior. Figure 2 depicts a generalized framework for this system where agent behaviors and interactions are dictated by LLM-driven decisions.
